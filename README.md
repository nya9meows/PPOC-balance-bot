# PPOC-balance-bot

This is a toy example of employing RL on a CPG embedded self-balancing robot. The simulating environment is a variation of an opensource tutorial by (https://github.com/yconst/balance-bot) based on Pybullet (https://pybullet.org/wordpress/). The RL library in our variation is Stable Baselines (https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html).
